The recruitment task for the artificial intelligence community "Golem" at WEiTI PW for our team, consisting of [@ondrey-16](https://github.com/ondrey-16) and [@xxxDKGxxx](https://github.com/xxxDKGxxx), involved participating in the Kaggle competition "Regression with an Insurance Dataset." Our goal was to analyze the performance of machine learning models from three popular Python libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and PyTorch. The entire notebook was created and written in Google Colab.
